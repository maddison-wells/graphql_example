# Intro to GraphQL

## Monday 8th April

### Progress

- Had a read through the documentation at https://graphql.org/

- Read through the [Apollo server documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/) as well (similar to Postman)

- Started a small project to solidify my knowledge, following along to this tutorial on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5199E50O7SI&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org)

### Notes

It was interesting reading the differences between GraphQL and a traditional REST API, particularly around the idea of overfetching and underfetching.

#### What was covered in the GraphQL tutorial?

- Query Basics
- Making a GraphQL Server (with Apollo)
- Schema & Types
- Resolver Functions
- Query Variables
- Related Data
- Mutations (Adding & Deleting Data)
- Update Mutation

#### Cons

- Initially complex - easy to write bad queries which undermine the benefits
- Need to consider the specific data being requested in each query and how it should be cached
- Single endpoint not as secure
- May not have same level of maturity and tools compared to traditional REST API
- Schema versions/ backward compatibility

### Tasks

Complete the tutorial and make note of any further details to research as I go
